===========

A new keyboard for iOS 8.

So far, I found the following information:

[Apple Typography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography_of_Apple_Inc.)

[Apple Extended Keyboard](http://deskthority.net/wiki/Apple_Extended_Keyboard_II)

[More KB info](http://boredzo.org/aek2-overlay/)

So now I want to build the iOS Extended Keyboard. Because I am a silly person with a long memory.
